      <h1>Home and School Communication</h1>
      <h2>Orientation Day</h2>
      <p>This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
        opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
        hour. It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
        overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.
        The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
        orientation	schedule). The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
        Thursday. This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
        before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Parent-Staff Communication</h2>
        <p>Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
            give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
            emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
            concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
            or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
        <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
            conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
            9
            keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
            development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
            writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
            in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	
            The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
            informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
            more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
            time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.</p>
