            <h2>Parent-Teacher Conferences and Assessment</h2>
            <p>
              Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
              students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
              group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
              informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
              and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
              Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
              curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
              child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
              read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
                conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
                keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
                development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
                writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
                in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.</p> -->

          <h2>Orientation Day</h2>
          <p> Orientation Day is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
              opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
              hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
              overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.</p>
          <p>The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
              orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
              Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
              before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
