            <h2>Assessment and Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
            <p>
              Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
              students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
              group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
              informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
              and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
              Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
              curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
              child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
              read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
            </p>
            <p>Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
                conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
                keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
                development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
                writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
                in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.</p>
