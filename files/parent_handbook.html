      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Parking</h2>
        <p>Free	parking	is	available	adjacent	to	the	Nursery	School.		These	three, 30-minute	spots	are	
          typically	available	during	the	school	day.		Parking	in	Zone	3	is	only	permitted	with	a	Yellow	
          Zone	3	parking	pass.		Parents	and	visitors	wishing	to	have a longer	visit	should	park	in	the	
          Millbrook	or	Snow	Way	parking	garages,	located	off	Throop	Drive	and	Snow	Way.		Visitor	
          parking	in	these	lots	is	$2.00	for	the	first	two hours.		The	Nursery	School	will	provide	
          validation	tickets	to	parents	that	park	in	the	garage	for	special	school	events.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Medication</h2>
        <p>The	nursery	school	encourages	parents	to administer	medications	at	home	and	not at	school.		
            The	nursery	school	staff	does	not	routinely	administer	medications	to	the	children.		Also,	we	
            do	not	apply sunscreen	or	insect	repellent.		Medication	that	absolutely	needs	to	be	
            administered	during	school	hours	must	be	cleared	with	the	director.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Allergies</h2>
        <p>If	your	child	has	a	known	allergic	reaction,	this	must	be	documented	on	the	child’s	History	
          and	Health	Record	kept	in	his/	her	file	in	the	office.		Also,	please	report	these	allergies	to	the
          classroom	teachers.		For	your	child’s	safety,	these	allergies	will be	posted	in	your	child’s	
          classroom.		If	you	object	to	this	information	being	posted,	please	contact	the	director.		In	case	
          of	severe	allergies	such	as	to	bee	stings or	nuts,	an	EpiPen	Injector	Kit	may	be	kept	at	the	
          nursery	school	and	used	by	the	director	and/or	teachers	who	are	trained	in	its	
          administration.		This	is	stored	in	the	emergency	backpack in	the	child’s	classroom.		Each	
          classroom	has	a	First	Aid	Kit	that	includes	the	EpiPen	(if	required).		This,	along	with	
          emergency	medical	forms	for	every	child,	accompanies	the	classes	on	all	walking	or	driving	
          field	trips.</p>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Accidents</h2>
        <p>The	nursery	school	makes	every	effort	to	ensure	the	safety	of	all	children.		However,	should	a	
          serious	accident	occur,	a	parent	is	immediately	contacted.		If	parents	and	emergency	contacts	
          cannot	be	reached,	we	will	take	your	child	to	the	hospital	designated	on	your	enrollment	
          form.		Minor	injuries	will	be	reported	to	you	by	your	child’s	teacher	at	pick-up.	All	injuries	
          will	also	be	reported	in	written	form	and	given	to	you	at	pickup	time.	We	will	ask	you	to	sign	
          an	identical	form	to	be	placed in	your	child’s	file	at	school.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-item">
        <h2>Health Policy</h2>
        <p>The	nursery	school	makes	a	great	effort	to	provide	a	healthy	environment	for	your	children.		
          We	work	diligently	on	forming	healthy	habits	such	as	washing	hands	before	eating	or	
          handling	food,	and	after	toileting.		Our	dishes	and	cups	are	put	through	a	dishwasher/	
          sanitizer	to	sterilize	them	and	to	prevent	the	spread	of	germs.		The	rooms	are	thoroughly
          cleaned	daily	and	checked	for	safety.		However,	despite	everyone’s	best	efforts,	children	and	
          adults	will	get	sick.		It	is	an	expected	part	of	life.		If	children	become	ill	at	school,	they	will	be	
          cared	for	in	the	office	until	a	parent	can	pick	them	up.</p>
          <p>Parents	are	requested	to	keep	their	child	home	in	the	event	of	the	diseases	or	symptoms	
          noted	below.		The	child	will	be	allowed	to	return	to	school	when	he	or	she	has	been	free	of	
          these	symptoms	and	has	not	required	medication	for	a	minimum	of	24	hours.		If	a	symptom	
          persists	(such	as	rash	or	cough),	or	if	a	communicable	disease	is	confirmed	(measles,	chicken	
          pox,	etc.),	returning	to	school	may	require	a	statement	from	the	child’s	physician	declaring	
          that	the	condition	is	no	longer	contagious.		
          PLEASE	CALL	the	nursery	school	to	inform	us	that	your	child	is	sick,	especially	if	he/	she	has	
          a	communicable	disease.	</p>
