        <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
  
        <h2>At	Washington	University	Nursery	School,	we	believe	that	children	are	unique	individuals	
          with	their	own	patterns	and	timetables	for	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
          development.		We	support	and	encourage	their	development	through	our	child-centered,	
          process-oriented,	play-based	curriculum	built	on	Constructivist	theories	and	practices.</h2>
  
        <p>Guided	by	the	teachings	of	educational	theorists	including	Piaget,	Dewey,	Vygotsky,	DeVries,	
          and	others,	we	create	a	learning	environment	that	addresses	the	developmental	needs	of	the	
          whole	child	by:</p>

        <ul class="indent-list">
          <li>Structuring	classroom	experiences	around	ideas	and	topics	that	are	relevant	to	the	
            students,	with	the	understanding	that	knowledge	is	constructed	through	language,	
            discussion,	experimentation,	and	manipulation	of	objects	that	are	meaningful	to	
            them.</li>
            <li>Offering	learning	experiences	that	appeal	to	multiple	senses	and	that	provide	handson	activities	using	materials	that	encourage	exploration,	investigation,	and	learning.</li>
            <li>Allowing	each	child	to	interact	with	the	environment	at	his/her	own	pace,	and	
              creating	opportunities	for	children	to	explore	individually,	with	a	partner,	or	with	a	
              larger	group	of	peers.</li>
            <li>Asking	open-ended	questions,	allowing	students	the	time	to	thoughtfully	form	
              responses,	listening	respectfully	to	their	answers,	and	gently	guiding	them	toward	
              the	answers	they seek	as	they	develop	enhanced	reasoning	skills.</li>
            <li>Respecting	students’	ideas,	encouraging	independent	thinking,	and	empowering	
              students	to	become	problem	solvers.</li>
            <li>Using	the	wonderful	resource	of	our	diverse,	multi-cultural	population	to	highlight	
              the	similarities	and	differences	between	individuals,	families,	and	cultures,	
              celebrating	the	unique	environment	that	is	Washington	University	Nursery	School.</li>
        </ul>
  
        <p>The	Washington	University	Nursery	School’s	open	curriculum	framework	is	presented	to	
          children	in	ways	that	are	developmentally	appropriate	and	based	on	our	philosophy	that	
          children	learn	most	effectively through	play.		Using	a	learning	center	approach,	each	teaching	
          team	offers	experiences	in	art,	writing,	science,	dramatic	play,	blocks,	manipulatives,	and	
          literacy.		Teacher	planning	takes	into	account	the	social,	emotional,	intellectual,	and	physical	
          developmental	needs	of	the	child.</p>
