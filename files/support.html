        <h2>Support</h2>
        <p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
            an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
            meet students’ needs.
        </p>
        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:</p>
          <ul class="indent-list">
            <li>
              Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
              process, build trust, and increase student confidence
            </li>
            <li>
              Offering more opportunities for exploration
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
            </li>
            <li>
              Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
            </li>
            <li>
              Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
              order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
            </li>
            <li>
              Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
              concept, skill, or area of concern
            </li>

        <p>The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
        appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
        stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
        the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
        their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
        more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
        lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.</p>
        <p>Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
        children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
        learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done
