        <h2>For Current Students</h2>
        <p>
          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
          an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
          meet students’ needs. 
        </p>
        <p>If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety of ways, which may include:</p>
          <ul class="indent-list">
            <li>
              Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
              process, build trust, and increase student confidence
            </li>
            <li>
              Offering more opportunities for exploration
            </li>
            <li>
              Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli
            </li>
            <li>
              Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration
            </li>
            <li>
              Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
              order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process
            </li>
            <li>
              Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
              concept, skill, or area of concern
            </li>

        <h2>For New Students</h2>
        <p> Orientation Day is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
            opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
            hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
            overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year.</p>
        <p>The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
            orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
            Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
            before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.</p>
